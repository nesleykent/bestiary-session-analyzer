 *
 *   Minor charms cost Minor Charm Echoes, which are not charm points at all.
 *   They are earned by unlocking Major charm stages — 50, 100 and 200 for
 *   stages 1, 2 and 3 — so majors fund minors. A promoted character also
 *   receives 100.
 *
 * Neither budget can cover everything, which is why this tracker reports budgets
 * rather than a collection:
 *
 *   majors need 48,900 charm points, and only 37,231 exist in the game
 *   minors need 5,225 echoes, and maxing every major yields 4,900 (+100 promoted)
 *
 * Costs come from the dataset, not from these notes; the notes only explain why
 * the two currencies are kept apart.
